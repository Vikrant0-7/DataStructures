# About
This is repository contains implementations of various data structures
which I made as college assignment. Data structures includes.

* Stacks
* Queues
* Binary Search Trees
* Heaps
* AVL Trees
* Dynamic Array
**Note**: Implementation of AVL is currently not complete. It lacks ability of deleting nodes. Although inseartion works fine.
